AI interaction overview: used Deep seek

Prompting Details:

We asked it to help improve the layout of our website, adding animated objects on our website page, and generate a quiz for our website.
We used AI to help walk us through technical error we were facing, for instance, "how do I code it in vs studio and see live results", the AI gave us a set of steps to follow which helped us see our live results including the method and a way to do a quick test. We also asked the AI for assistance in creating a smooth scrolling feature. 

Project Evolution:
It helped us fix minor mistakes and helps us with aligning our overall website to look more refined. It helped give us something to start from when it came to our color palette, we used the colors given as a base from which we found other colors that suited our aesthetic best and then found the relevant hexadecimals and RGB’s.
We were able to build off a smooth scrolling feature with the help of AI and implement it in our JavaScript file.
